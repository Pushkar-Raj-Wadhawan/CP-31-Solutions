List of n arrays is given. Each array has atleast 2 elements in it. Each array has a current minimum element in it and its potential (min element in the array if current minimum element is removed from it).
Because for max beauty, we will put all min current elements in the array having min potential. 
So, Answer is nothing but: (sum of potential of each array) - (minPotential) + (minCurr)
