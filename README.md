# CP-31 Solution Sheet

Welcome to the **CP-31 Solution Sheet**! This repository contains solutions to programming problems across a range of difficulty ratings—1000, 1100, 1200, all the way up to 1900. The primary goal is to provide clear, efficient solutions in **C++** along with explanations of the approaches that worked.

## Structure

- Each rating category (e.g., 1000, 1100, ...) will have its own folder.
- Solutions for each problem are written in C++ and organized by problem code.
- For most problems, there will be an accompanying `approach.txt` file, where I describe the main ideas, algorithms, and techniques used to solve the problem.

## Example Directory Layout

```
CP-31-Solutions/
│
├── 1000/
│   ├── [problem-code].cpp
│   └── [problem-code]_approach.txt
│
├── 1100/
├── 1200/
│   └── ...
└── 1900/
```

## How to Use

- Browse directories by rating to find solutions to problems in your target range.
- Read the `approach.txt` files for explanations and learning material.
- All code is well-commented for easy understanding.

## Goals

- Help others learn approaches to common and tricky CP problems.
- Provide a growing library of C++ sample solutions for Codeforces/competitive programming problems.
- Make learning algorithmic techniques accessible via concise explanations.

## Contributing

Currently, this is a personal sheet, but if you'd like to contribute or discuss an approach, feel free to open an issue!
